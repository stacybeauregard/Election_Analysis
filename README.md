# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

After working with Seth to write some code to analyze the county congressional election, the commission has asked for the code to be revised to include voter turnout for each county including the vote percentage and total count of the votes. In addition, they'd like to be able to easily see the county with the highest turnout.

## Results

## Summary

We can further define the election results for the county commission with future elections by adding in the method of voting - did the constituent vote early? by mail? in person?

We can also suggest that they add the political party (if applicable)  to each candidate
